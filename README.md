# Hi there 👋

## 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- building automated tools to support the public sector 
- improving the developer experience in government
- mentoring under-represented groups in tech

## 🌱 I'm currently learning
- how to make the most out of AWS' many services
- how to lead in a complex space
- how to bake

## 😍 I'm really proud of...
- [this project to try to match mentors and mentees](https://github.com/jonodrew/mentor-match), which reduced a task from 30+ hous of manual work to 2m 30s of compute time
- [the reporting module I wrote for a project to track interventions and promotions](https://github.com/jonodrew/talent-tracker/tree/master/reporting) - it was the first time I used the factory pattern and I'm really pleased with how it turned out
- my mentees, like [Miriam](https://github.com/mforner13) who continuously inspire and amaze me
- [this blog, which I've been running for years](https://caffeinatedpunctuation.co.uk/2020/12/03/pen-portrait/)
