# Hi there 👋

## 🔭 I’m currently working on...

## 😍 I'm really proud of...
- [this project to try to match people on development programmes with roles](https://github.com/jonodrew/graduate-rotator)
- [the reporting module I wrote for a project to track interventions and promotions](https://github.com/jonodrew/talent-tracker/tree/master/reporting) - it was the first time I used the factory pattern and I'm really pleased with how it turned out
- my mentees, who continuously inspire and amaze me
